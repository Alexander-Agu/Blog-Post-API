# Blog App API (ASP.NET)

A simple RESTful Blog API built with **ASP.NET Core** for learning and practicing backend development with a focus on **entity relationships**. This project is beginner-friendly and demonstrates how to create, read, and delete data using **Entity Framework Core**, along with **one-to-many relationships**.

This API simulates a basic blog system with three main entities:

- **User** ‚Äì the author of blog posts
